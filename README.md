# Breast Cancer
The objective of this project is to determine based on the data of the tumor whether the person gets malignant or benign cancerous tumor. 
Using SVM or support-vector machines algorithm/model, I was able to predict correctly up to 98% of the testing data. In addition, I compared the effiency and accuracy of KNN and SVM algorithm and draw a conclusive finding: SVM is more often better than KNN in classification problems.
